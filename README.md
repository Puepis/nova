# Nova 

Finding sources for medical research papers is a very challenging and time consuming process. Most articles/papers that are screened are not included as a source in the final project. 

Nova aims to streamline the process of finding credible research sources to support your papers. It accomplishes this by providing a one-stop-shop to aggregate, filter, and review potential citations from high quality peer-reviewed journals.
